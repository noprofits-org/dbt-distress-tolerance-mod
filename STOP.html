          <h3 class="mb-3">Overview</h3>
          <p>The STOP skill is one of the key crisis survival strategies in DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy). It's designed to help you pause in moments of high emotion or crisis before reacting in ways that might make things worse.</p>
          <p>STOP is an acronym that stands for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>S</strong>top</li>
            <li><strong>T</strong>ake a step back</li>
            <li><strong>O</strong>bserve</li>
            <li><strong>P</strong>roceed mindfully</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This skill is especially useful when you're feeling overwhelmed or when your emotions are threatening to drive impulsive behaviors.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Literally stop what you're doing. Freeze. Don't move a muscle! Don't act immediately on your urges, feelings, or impulses. Put the brakes on whatever you're about to say or do.</p>
            <div class="quote">

            </div>
            <p>Take a step back from the situation. This could be physical (actually stepping away) or mental (detaching from your emotional response). Take a break. Take a deep breath. Count to 10.</p>
            <div class="quote">
              "When I'm about to react to my emotions, I need to Take a step back, creating space between my feelings and my actions."

            <p>Notice what's going on inside and outside of you. What is the situation? What are your thoughts and feelings? What are others saying or doing? Try to observe without judgment.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-3">A Humorous Example: The Team Meeting Meltdown</h3>
          
          <p><strong>The Situation:</strong> Dave is in a team meeting when his coworker Sarah takes credit for an idea he shared last week. Dave feels his blood pressure rising and his face getting hot. He's about to blurt out "That was MY idea, actually!" in front of the whole team.</p>
          
          <div class="mb-3">
            <strong>S - Stop:</strong> Dave catches himself just before speaking. He feels his mouth open but clamps it shut. His brain is yelling "STOP RIGHT THERE!" like a traffic cop.
          </div>
          
          <div class="mb-3">
            <strong>T - Take a step back:</strong> Dave takes a deep breath and mentally steps back from his anger. He imagines his rage as a cartoon character jumping up and down beside him rather than controlling him. He thinks, "Well, hello there, Mr. Fury. I see you're visiting again."
          </div>
          
          <div class="mb-3">
            <strong>O - Observe:</strong> Dave notices his physical sensations: racing heart, sweaty palms, tight jaw. He observes his thoughts: "She's stealing my thunder! Everyone will think I never have good ideas!" He notices that the meeting is actually going well, and the boss seems pleased with the progress.
          </div>
          
          <div class="mb-3">
            <strong>P - Proceed mindfully:</strong> Dave considers his options. He could: 1) Call Sarah out and create tension, 2) Silently stew in resentment, or 3) Find a constructive way to acknowledge his contribution. He decides to wait for a natural pause and then say, "I'm glad we're developing that idea I brought up last week. I think Sarah's added some great points to it."
          </div>
          
          <p><strong>The Result:</strong> Instead of creating workplace drama, Dave manages his emotions, maintains professional relationships, AND still gets appropriate credit for his contribution. Later, he treats himself to an extra-large coffee for handling a difficult situation with skill.</p>
