                    <h3 class="mb-3">Overview</h3>
                    <p>The STOP skill is one of the key crisis survival strategies in DBT (Dialectical Behavior
                        Therapy). It's designed to help you pause in moments of high emotion or crisis before reacting
                        in ways that might make things worse.</p>
                    <p>STOP is an acronym that stands for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>S</strong>top</li>
                        <li><strong>T</strong>ake a step back</li>
                        <li><strong>O</strong>bserve</li>
                        <li><strong>P</strong>roceed mindfully</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This skill is especially useful when you're feeling overwhelmed or when your emotions are
                        threatening to drive impulsive behaviors.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Situation:</strong> Dave is in a team meeting when his coworker Sarah takes credit
                        for an idea he shared last week. Dave feels his blood pressure rising and his face getting hot.
                        He's about to blurt out "That was MY idea, actually!" in front of the whole team.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <strong>S - Stop:</strong> Dave catches himself just before speaking. He feels his mouth open
                        but clamps it shut. His brain is yelling "STOP RIGHT THERE!" like a traffic cop.
                    </div>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <strong>T - Take a step back:</strong> Dave takes a deep breath and mentally steps back from his
                        anger. He imagines his rage as a cartoon character jumping up and down beside him rather than
                        controlling him. He thinks, "Well, hello there, Mr. Fury. I see you're visiting again."
                    </div>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <strong>O - Observe:</strong> Dave notices his physical sensations: racing heart, sweaty palms,
                        tight jaw. He observes his thoughts: "She's stealing my thunder! Everyone will think I never
                        have good ideas!" He notices that the meeting is actually going well, and the boss seems pleased
                        with the progress.
                    </div>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <strong>P - Proceed mindfully:</strong> Dave considers his options. He could: 1) Call Sarah out
                        and create tension, 2) Silently stew in resentment, or 3) Find a constructive way to acknowledge
                        his contribution. He decides to wait for a natural pause and then say, "I'm glad we're
                        developing that idea I brought up last week. I think Sarah's added some great points to it."
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>The Result:</strong> Instead of creating workplace drama, Dave manages his emotions,
                        maintains professional relationships, AND still gets appropriate credit for his contribution.
                        Later, he treats himself to an extra-large coffee for handling a difficult situation with skill.
